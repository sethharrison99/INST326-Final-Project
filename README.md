For example, here based off the menu, the user would input what items they want

If the user wants 5 brownies, that will be $15. Based off the reward system that would be 150 reward points that can be used to redeem an item. They would say "Yes" or "Not Now" as a response to the prompt.

If the user says "Yes", and chooses to get the cheeseburger (150 points), they get the cheeseburger, and are left with the difference of their reward points and the cost of the item, which in this case is zero. They now choose if they want to Dine-In, Pick-up, or have the item deliverered.

If you choose to pickup the item, you are given a random order ID, which you will be notified in a couple of seconds when it is read to be picked up, and then that's it
